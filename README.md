## Description
EduTrak is a time management meant to help students keep track of assignments by creating a to-do list of tasks that need to be completed. Users can manually upload tasks which can then be viewed on both our Calendar UI and List View of tasks. 

## Technologies Used
- Integrated Development Enviroment --- Android Studio
- Database and Authecation --- Firebase
- Languages --- XML and Java
- Collabration and Version Control --- GitHub

## Exceptions 
### Compotents Not Included
Some Compotents included in our inital Test Plan that was not implemented in our app include the Search feature for looking up tasks and the Automated Help Chatbot. 

### Partial Functionality 
The Schedule Scanner page is partially working. It allows to user to select a pdf file from their local storage and show the file path. However, the functionality to scan the selected file and upload the info from the pdf to the Calendar UI has not been implemented yet. In addition, Reminders and Notifications are not full functional yet either.
